        <p>Venezuelan Tequeños are a popular finger food that is made by wrapping a stick of cheese in dough and then frying until crispy. The dough is made with flour, water, salt, and sometimes a little sugar, and the cheese filling can be made with a variety of cheeses such as queso blanco or queso de mano. Tequeños are often served as an appetizer or snack and are a beloved part of Venezuelan cuisine.</p>
