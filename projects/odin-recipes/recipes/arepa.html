        <p>Venezuelan arepas are a popular food in Venezuela made from corn flour (Harina P.A.N), water, and salt. The dough is formed into patties, cooked on a griddle or skillet with oil or butter, and then split open to be filled with a variety of ingredients, such as cheese, meat, beans, avocado, and more. Arepas can be eaten any time of day and are often enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. They are a staple in Venezuelan cuisine and are enjoyed all over the country, as well as in other Latin American countries and around the world.</p>
